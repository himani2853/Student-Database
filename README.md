# Student-Database

The code manages student information using a Student structure. It reads data for a specified number of students and prompts the user to input an email address. 
Three functions are provided:

1) age_19: Prints names of students aged 19.
2) email_starts_with_I_T: Prints names of students with email addresses starting with 'I' or 'T'.
3) student_info_using_email: Displays details of a student based on their email address.
   The main function calls these functions according to user input.
